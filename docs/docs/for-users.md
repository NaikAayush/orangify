# For end-users

<!-- manage your digital credentials -->

## Features

- **All certificates in one place**: no need to carry or scan a dozen different papers.
- **Digitally verified**: verification can only be done by the issuing organization - easy to trust the certificates.
- **Easy application**: apply to jobs on **Beckn DSEP** without uploading a single document. All your work history and skills can be selected right through the app.
- **Upload your own**: for any organizations not on the platform, you can upload images of the certificates yourselves.
- **Decentralized**: your certificates are not stored on any single server. The private blockchain system ensures that all issuers have a stake in the system.

## App

When you first log in to the Orangify app, you will see all the types of certificates that are available to you. These may include academic certificates, professional licenses, and other important documents. You can view all of your certificates in one place, making it easy to keep track of your digital credentials.

If you have a certificate that is not already listed in Orangify, you can easily upload it by selecting the "upload certificate" button. Once uploaded, your certificate will be added to your collection and you can view it anytime you need to.

Orangify also allows you to view any certificates that have been issued to you by organizations. These certificates will be marked with the issuing organization's name, as well as the date the certificate was issued. You can view the details of each certificate, including any qualifications or achievements that are associated with it.
