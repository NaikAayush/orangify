# For Certificate Issuers

## Features

- **Avoid Forgery**: only you can verify certificates created by you. This is enforced using asymmetric key cryptography in a private blockchain system.
- **Decentralized**: avoid storing credentials on single servers or databases, which can be tampered or can get corrupted. With your participation in the private blockchain system, you can ensure its working.
- **Single Verification**: once verified digitally, all third-parties can trust them without having to reach out to you to verify them.
- **Easy Revocation**: a blockchain system does not mean that certificates are permanently verified. Any certificate can be revoked at any time, with the operation being recorded on the chain.
