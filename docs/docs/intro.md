# Orangify

Welcome to Orangify, a platform for **decentralized credential verification**, storage, and issuance.

Orangify is designed to provide a seamless and secure way for individuals and organizations to manage their digital credentials, such as **academic certificates**, **professional licenses**, and other important documents.

Orangify leverages the power of private blockchain technology (Hyperledger Besu) to augment the existing Beckn [DSEP APIs](https://github.com/beckn/DSEP-Specification), making it easier for users to verify their credentials and for organizations to issue and store them securely. This means that certificates are issued directly by the organizations themselves and cannot be forged, ensuring the authenticity of the credentials.



<!-- With Orangify, you can be confident that your credentials are **tamper-proof** and cannot be altered without your permission. Our decentralized approach eliminates the need for intermediaries, allowing you to maintain complete control over your data. Whether you're an individual looking to share your credentials with potential employers, or an organization seeking a more efficient way to manage and verify credentials, Orangify is the solution for you. -->
