# For Companies

Any company hiring new employees can streamline the process by levering verified credentials.

## Features

- **Skip document verification**: you do not need to reach out to the candidate's university or previous employers to verify their education or work experience.
- **Trust**: you can trust candidates more easily, reducing the friction and discomfort arising from distrust.
- **Faster applications**: receive more and higher quality applications.

## App

You can use any standard Beckn DSEP hiring app to post your job, get applications, etc. All you need to do is ask the candidates to apply using the [Orangify app](for-users.md) and select the right verified credentials. Once you receive the applications, you can verify the credentials using the link.

This powered by a custom Beckn Provider Platform (BPP) named `orangify-network-2` hosted at `https://bpp.orangify.network/beckn` that implements posting job opening and receiving applications using Orangify verified credentials.
